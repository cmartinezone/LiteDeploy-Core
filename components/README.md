# Components

Folders are numbered in the order LiteDeploy works. Numbers are for this development repo only. Production still publishes sibling scripts under `Engine\Scripts`.

## Before a device boots

| # | Folder | Runs when |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 01 | `01-Config` | An administrator generates `BootConfig.json` for the boot image or share. |
| — | [WinPEBuilder](https://github.com/cmartinezone/WinPEBuilder) | Builds ISO or `Boot.wim` for WDS/PXE from that config and the WinPE scripts. Separate repository. |
| — | [DeploymentShare](../DeploymentShare) | Initial share folder layout (`Config`, `Content`, `Engine`, `WorkFlows`, `WorkLogs`). |
| 02 | `02-DeploymentShareACL` | An administrator creates the share, SMB permissions, and log ACLs. |
| 03 | `03-LogWriter` | Loaded by later components as soon as WinPE logging starts. |
| 04 | `04-HostShell` | Loaded by BootInitializer to control the WinPE console. |
| — | [`04-UiHost`](04-UiHost) | Shared WPF theme/host helpers for PreCheck, SelectWorkflow, Progress. |

## On the device

| # | Folder | Runs when |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 05 | `05-BootInitializer` | `startnet.cmd` starts the parent PowerShell process. |
| 06 | `06-PreCheck` | DeploymentEngine invokes it with `BootObject`; returns a structured result. |
| 07 | `07-SelectWorkflow` | DeploymentEngine invokes it after PreCheck Continue; returns a structured selection. |
| 08 | `08-DeploymentEngine` | BootInitializer invokes it with `BootObject`; orchestrates PreCheck → SelectWorkflow → state (Setup later). |
| 09 | `09-Progress` | Planned as a separate process while the engine runs. |
| 10 | `10-Credentials` | Offline handoff and FullOS SYSTEM import. Code lives in [DeployVault](https://github.com/cmartinezone/DeployVault) and [WinPECT](https://github.com/cmartinezone/WinPECT). |

## Rules

- Put new work in the matching numbered folder, or add the next number at the point it runs.
- Keep production script names (`LiteDeploy.PreCheck.ps1`, not a new name per folder).
- `experiments/` is not part of this sequence and does not promote to LiteDeploy.
